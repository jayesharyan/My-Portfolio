<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Cloud Engineer II at Insight, I am passionate about crafting innovative solutions and driving technological advancements in the cloud domain. I have spearheaded automation initiatives that have significantly reduced manual intervention and streamlined operations across multiple Azure subscriptions, resulting in a remarkable 98% decrease in manual efforts and a bug-free environment.

  Prior to joining Insight, I was a Software Developer at Hanu Software, where I played a key role in designing and deploying scalable cloud-based solutions that led to a substantial increase in contract acquisition and customer satisfaction. I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, facilitated the implementation of actionable recommendations, and resolved infrastructure and application issues, resulting in a 50% improvement in insights gained and a 90% reduction in deployment failure issues.
  
  I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Asansol Engineering College, where I also completed a research internship at IIT ISM Dhanbad on particle swarm optimization for big data Hadoop. I am equipped with expertise in Python, C++, HTML5, CSS, JSON, PowerShell, and Django, as well as Microsoft Azure and Azure REST API. I am also adept at mentoring team members on new technologies and best practices, contributing to a culture of continuous learning and growth.</p>
